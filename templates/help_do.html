    <p class="h1">Communication on Voices City - The Dos and Don'ts</p>
    <p class="h3">The Dos:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            Voices City is your best option when it comes to payments and
            conversations, therefore never let such information leave the
            website.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            To be honest, if you were trying to sell anything on Voices City and
            then decided to move that sale off of Voices City, we can't
            guarantee your project or company security.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            Be professional at all times, especially while interacting on Voices
            City. We don't endorse bullying, harassment, discrimination, or hate
            speech on Voices City.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="h3">The Dontâ€™s:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            Sharing passwords, credit card details, Social Security numbers, or
            other sensitive information is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            If you're not sure who you're chatting with, avoid clicking links or
            opening attachments in any emails you get.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            As an added layer of protection, we suggest that you always use an
            antivirus program on your own device.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            It is not advisable to participate in any kind of online discussion
            that makes you feel uneasy. If you do get such a communication, DO
            NOT reply to it; instead, contact Customer Support
            (Support@voicescity.com) to report the sender's identity
            immediately.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            As is often the case, remote access programs such as TeamViewer and
            AnyDesk are a privacy concern, since they may put you at risk of
            your system being compromised by the other party. If you must use
            such a tool, be certain that no operations are permitted. Do not
            share them if you want to keep your personal data safe.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="h4">Note:</p>
    <p class="h5 font-weight-light">
