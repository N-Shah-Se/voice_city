        How does the Secure Payment (SafeBox) method work for clients?
    </p>
    <p class="h5 font-weight-light">
        Voicescity has rolled out a Secure Payment (SafeBox) system Called
        SafeBox where Voicescity acts as a guarantor for the transaction.
    </p>
    <p class="h5 font-weight-light">
        The service is absolutely free and is applied to every job.
    </p>
    <p class="h5 font-weight-light">
        This means that we wonâ€™t subtract any funds from the amount the voice
        actor has agreed to and we will send them the full amount.
    </p>
    <p class="h5 font-weight-light">It will be a simple 4 step system:</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            The client posts a job and then voiceover actors can start bidding
            on the job. Voicescity will then start to manage the transaction
            until the final recording is accepted.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            As soon as the client wants to award the project to the actor, the
            client transfers the payment to Voicescity.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            Afterwards, A mutual agreement is accepted by both the parties.
        </li>
        <li class="h5 font-weight-light">
            Voicescity holds the payment in SafeBox until the final recording is
            accepted. Voicescity then releases it to the voice actor
